Full statespace search for:
	never claim         	+ (p1)
	assertion violations	+ (if within scope of claim)
	acceptance   cycles 	+ (fairness disabled)
	invalid end states	- (disabled by never claim)

State-vector 164 byte, depth reached 100, errors: 0
      129 states, stored
      146 states, matched
      275 transitions (= stored+matched)
       35 atomic steps

Stats on memory usage (in Megabytes):
    0.024	equivalent memory usage for states (stored*(State-vector + overhead))
    0.242	actual memory usage for states
